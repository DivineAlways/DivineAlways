👋 Hi, I’m @DivineAlways

👀 I’m interested in AWS, Linux, Web3, data analysis, and building innovative microservices. I love exploring the intersections of gaming, consciousness, and technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, LangChain, LangFlow, Kubernetes, and TaskMatrix while working on projects involving APIs, data pipelines, and gamified learning experiences.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web3 applications, data-driven dashboards, microservices for gaming or finance, and interactive learning systems.

📫 How to reach me: dfluellen3@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I’m building a gaming dashboard and crafting gamified learning experiences—because learning should feel like an epic quest!
